    "# Introduction: \n",
    "\n",
    "**The research project**\n",
    "The Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI) at UBC, led by Professor Frank Wood, is trying to build embodied AI agents that can behave like real human players inside Minecraft. Data was taken from players in a minecraft server called PLAICraft, and the players’ behaviours and traits were recorded. Currently, there are 196 observations of players, and in order to save resources, such as software licenses and server hardware, they need to recruit players who will play on the server for several hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The question**\n",
    "We want to know if player's characteristics, like their experience, subscription to the game's newsletter, and gender can predict how long in hours a player would play according to the dataset players?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**\n",
    "To better grasp human players behaviors to build a believable AI, significant amounts of data is needed. This data is collected through interactions the players will have in the server. So it is crucial for the recruted participants to stay online for longer amounts of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 characteristics of the players were chosen to be able to provide a comprehensive list of what should be prioritised when recruiting efforts. Since all 3 are all self identified, they may provide bias (social desirability in reporting gender, or overstatement of experience, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "The demographic of age was not chosen because as seen in the exploration of the data below, most players have similar ages. The high concentration around a single age group doesnt allow for age to have significance when recruiting. The highest and the lowest contibuting player will both most likely be in the same age range. Age is also a risky variable for prediction since the targeted players could grow older over the time of the research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only data set players is needed for this question as it has all the information about the demographic. Sessions could be useful to then see players habits but just to answer the question of most data collected, player habits would be too specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The dataset: players**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 196 observations over rows for 7 variables in the columns of a tibble:\n",
    "\n",
    "|**variable**|**data type**|**categories**|**meaning**|\n",
    "|-|-|-|-|\n",
    "| experience | character | 5 | skillset of the player: Beginner, Amateur, Regular, Veteran, Pro|\n",
    "| subscribe | logical | 2 | indicating active subscription status: TRUE (subscribed) or FALSE (not subscribed) |\n",
    "| hashedEmail | character | 196 | unique identifications |\n",
    "| played_hours | real number | n/a | time in hours spent on the server by a player |\n",
    "| name | character | 196 | unique identifications |\n",
    "| gender | character | 7 | gender of the player : Male, Female, Non-binary, Agender, Two-Spirited, Prefer not to say, Other|\n",
    "| age | real number | n/a | age of the player |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "potential issues:\n",
    "- gender variable is inclusive but could reduce data accuracy since categories like \"Prefer not to say\" introduce ambiguity, as they could represent individuals from another gender group\n",
    "- positively skewed played_hours, majority of values are very close to 0h with a few big outliers (around 200h)\n",
    "- 3 (experience, gender, age) of the variables are self identified, they may provide bias (social desirability in reporting age or gender, or overstatement of experience, etc).\n",
    "  - emails and name are self identified as well but are not determining characteristics of players that affect play-time/engagenent. they identify too specifically and dont represent a \"type\" of player\n"

    "The Predicted vs Actual Played Hours plot reveals that the k-NN regression model performed poorly in estimating players’ actual playtime. Ideally, predictions should align closely with the 45-degree dashed line, indicating accurate estimates. Instead, the majority of predicted values cluster near zero, even when the actual played hours span a much wider range. This pattern shows that the model systematically underestimates higher playtime values and fails to capture the underlying relationships in the data. The few points with larger predicted values do not correspond meaningfully to their actual values, suggesting inconsistent behavior from the model. This visual assessment aligns with the quantitative metrics (R² ≈ 0.002, RMSE ≈ 5), which indicate that the model explains virtually none of the variance in played hours and makes large prediction errors. Overall, the plot confirms that the k-NN regression model is not effective for this dataset, likely due to weak predictor–target relationships and the presence of categorical predictors that k-NN handles poorly."
